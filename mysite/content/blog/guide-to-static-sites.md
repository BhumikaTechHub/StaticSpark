# A Guide to Static Site Generators
Static site generators (SSGs) are powerful tools for creating websites that are fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

## Benefits of Using SSGs
- Speed : Static sites are incredibly fast.
- Security : No server-side logic means fewer vulnerabilities.
- Cost-Effective : Host your static site on platforms like GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages for free.

## Is It Right for You?
If you’re building a blog, portfolio, or documentation site, then yes! However, dynamic sites may be better for e-commerce or user-driven platforms.
