# How I Built My Static Site Generator
Creating a static site generator was both challenging and rewarding. Here’s a breakdown of the process.

## Step 1: Understanding the Basics
I started by researching how static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll worked. The key components are:
- Templates for layout.
- Markdown files for content.
- A build system to generate static files.

## Step 2: Coding the Generator
Using Python, I implemented:
- Markdown-to-HTML conversion.
- Jinja2 templates for dynamic content.
- A live server for development.

## Step 3: Testing and Deployment
After testing locally, I deployed the site using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

Building this project helped me improve my coding skills and taught me about web architecture. If you’re interested, give it a try!
